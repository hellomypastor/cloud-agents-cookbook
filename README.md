# Qoder Cloud Agents Cookbook

[简体中文](./README.zh-CN.md) · [Contributing](./CONTRIBUTING.md) · [Content contracts](./docs/metadata-contract.md) · [Qoder Cloud Agents](https://qoder.com/cloud/quickstart)

Qoder Cloud Agents Cookbook is the public source repository for practical, read-only guidance about building, deploying, operating, and evaluating cloud agents. Every published Cookbook page comes from a reviewed pull request in this repository. An article may also include a strongly bound Demo source directory that remains on GitHub and is excluded from Cookbook publication.

## Content types

| Type | Use it for |
|---|---|
| Recipe | A focused, repeatable way to complete one task |
| Best Practice | Production guidance, boundaries, and trade-offs |
| Showcase | An end-to-end scenario and its outcome |
| Workshop | Structured learning or team training material |

Content is available in `zh-CN` and `en-US` and is organized under `content/<locale>/<type>/<slug>/index.md`. Optional source lives at `demos/<slug>/`, where the Demo slug must match its owner article. Launch content will be added through reviewed pull requests; this initial repository intentionally contains no fabricated publishable articles or runnable Demos.

```text
content/<locale>/<type>/<slug>/index.md   published as a Cookbook page
demos/<slug>/                             optional GitHub-only Demo source
```

## Contribute

1. Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
2. Copy one of the templates from [`templates/`](./templates/).
3. Create an article with local assets under `content/`.
4. Optionally add a bound `demos/<slug>/` directory and link it from the article.
5. Optionally run the recommended local checks if Node.js 20 or later is available.
6. Commit with `git commit -s` and open a pull request.

Local validation is not required to submit. GitHub Actions validates every pull request automatically and provides the required article preview. Demo source is inspected only as untrusted data: automation never installs, builds, tests, or runs it. Passing checks prove that the submission satisfies machine-verifiable contracts; maintainers still review accuracy, source, run instructions, safety, licensing, and publication value. Only a maintainer merges an approved pull request.

## Optional local validation

These commands are recommended for faster feedback when Node.js 20 or later is available:

```bash
npm ci --ignore-scripts
npm run check
```

The generated preview is written to `dist/preview/` and is not committed. Contributors without Node.js can open a pull request directly and review the preview produced by GitHub Actions.

## Browse locally

Run `npm ci --ignore-scripts`, then `npm run dev`, and open <http://localhost:4173/en-US/> (Chinese: `/zh-CN/`). The site supports search, topic/type filters, article pages, and translation links. After editing content or UI, run `npm run build:site` and refresh. Set `PORT` to change the local port.

`npm run build:site` produces a static, GitHub Pages-compatible directory at `dist/site/`; it does not deploy. The existing `npm run preview` remains the editorial preview. Because `npm run check` rebuilds `dist/`, rebuild the site afterward.
